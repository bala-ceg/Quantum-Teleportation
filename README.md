# Quantum-Teleportation
Asja wants to send a qubit to Balvis by using only classical communication.

Let |𝑣⟩=(𝑎,𝑏)∈ ℝ^2 be the quantum state.

Discussion: If Asja has many copies of this qubit, then she can collect the statistics based on these qubits and obtain an approximation of 𝑎 and 𝑏, say 𝑎̃  and 𝑏̃ , respectively. After this, Asja can send 𝑎̃  and 𝑏̃  by using many classical bits, the number of which depends on the precision of the amplitudes.

On the other hand, If Asja and Balvis share the entangled qubits in state  1/sqrt(2)(|00⟩+|11⟩)  in advance, then it is possible for Balvis to create  |𝑣⟩  in his qubit after receiving two bits of information from Asja.
